Today the Bureau of Meteorology releases its end-of-month seasonal outlook for April to June, updating the initial outlook released on March 15. But you might not have seen much media coverage of it, because we’re not seeing big swings towards the attention-grabbing [climate drivers](http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/about/) like [El Niño](http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/about/?bookmark=enso) or the [Indian Ocean Dipole](http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/about/?bookmark=iod), which can dominate Australia’s climate.


There are times when the main drivers of our climate are not strong enough to push us towards a season dominated by unusually wet or dry, or hot or cool, weather. This can also happen if different climate drivers are having opposite impacts – they can cancel each other out.

Without a strong push one way or another, our outlook maps are often white. This is a neutral or “50:50” outlook map.

In contrast, the rainfall outlook map for October 2015 (right) shows a low chance of exceeding the median (so brown dominates the map). Bureau of Metereology
