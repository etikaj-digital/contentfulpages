title: 'Essays On Air: Joan of Arc, our one true superhero'
---
One need not be a parent of a young child, as I am, to be conscious of the full-blown resurgence of the superhero in contemporary popular culture. But there is more to a hero than courage and strength.

On today’s episode of [Essays On Air](https://theconversation.com/au/topics/essays-on-air-48405), the audio version of The Conversation’s Friday essay series, I’m reading [my essay on Joan of Arc, our one true superhero](https://theconversation.com/friday-essay-joan-of-arc-our-one-true-superhero-81097).

She’s been depicted as a national heroine and a nationalist symbol (and also, to my and many a leftists’ dismay, a popular mascot by French ultra-nationalists), a rebellious heretic and a goodly saint. A feminist role model and a belligerent military leader, an innocent mystic and a tortured victim.

However one may choose to view her, there can be no denying that she is, and will continue to be, one of the most singular and significant exemplars of our troubled species. Forget Wonder Woman and Batman – Jeanne d’Arc may be our one and only true superhero.
