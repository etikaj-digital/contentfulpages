title: 'Politics podcast: John Blaxland on Australia''s expulsion of Russian spies'
---
As Russian Ambassador Grigory Logvinov and Foreign Minister Julie Bishop trade verbal blows, ANU professor John Blaxland says the expulsion of two Russian spies from Australia will have a significant effect on Russia’s espionage here.

Blaxland told The Conversation that ideologically we’re not seeing a new Cold War but the interconnectedness of the world means that activities by Russia create new vulnerabilities. “In some ways the threat is as great, if not greater.”
