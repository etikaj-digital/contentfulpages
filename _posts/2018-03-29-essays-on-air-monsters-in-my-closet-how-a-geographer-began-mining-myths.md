So you think the Loch Ness Monster never existed? Think again.

The science of “geomythology” is breathing new life into such stories. The Loch Ness Monster and other folk tales might not be pure fiction, but actually based on memories of events our ancestors once observed.

On today’s episode of [Essays On Air](https://theconversation.com/au/podcasts/Essays-On-Air), the audio version of The Conversation’s Friday essay series, I’m reading [my essay on the geographical truths behind some of humankind’s most mysterious myths](https://theconversation.com/friday-essay-monsters-in-my-closet-how-a-geographer-began-mining-myths-85596). 

Traditional stories about age-old events might actually reveal clues about the geological history of the Pacific.

Through research of ancient oral knowledge, we have opened up opportunities for understanding the minds of our ancestors, more than we ever thought possible.
