_Six months after the explosive[allegations of sexual harassment](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/05/us/harvey-weinstein-harassment-allegations.html) against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein came to light, giving impetus to the #MeToo movement, this [series](https://theconversation.com/au/topics/after-metoo-50716) looks at the aftermath of the movement, and if it has brought about lasting change to sexual harassment and gender equality._


The sexual revolution may have given women greater licence to express their sexuality, but it did not free them from the impact of societal double standards. Nor did it create an environment for better understanding between the sexes. Rather, it created a blurring of traditional codes of etiquette between the sexes, widening the grey zone between consented seduction and sexual aggression. 

Top-down draconian measures that punish men and women for acting on their sexual attraction are unlikely to expunge cultures of disrespect towards women. 

Addressing more recalcitrant aspects of disrespectful cultures requires better communication and understanding between men and women. This means talking to one another about some of the stereotypes that create unrealistic expectations and undermine respectful relations. 

In her recent book, [“Reclaiming Conversation”](http://www.reclaimingconversationbook.com/), MIT professor Sheryl Turkle argues for meaningful face-to-face conversations, as opposed to online communication, to enable greater self-knowledge and empathy in relationships.

This is a challenge in a time-poor culture in which quality communication is on the decline. But avoiding these crucial conversations means risking continuing ignorance, misunderstanding, micro aggression and violence.
