title: Art Gallery SA goes back to Impressionism's colourful roots with masterpieces
  from Musee d'Orsay
---
In the 1970s, art history was being rewritten by a generation of young scholars, including [TJ Clark](https://www.berkeley.edu./news/media/releases/2006/02/01_clarkmellon.shtml) and a host of other neo-Marxists, who argued that painting was more than just a means of arranging colours on the surface of a canvas for aesthetic purposes. Art, they said, was also a mirror of society and of its political aspirations. By the turn of the century, this view had become the standard way of analysing movements such as Impressionism. 

[Colours of Impressionism: Masterpieces from the Musée d’Orsay](https://www.artgallery.sa.gov.au/agsa/home/Exhibitions/ComingSoon/Colours_of_Impressionism), at the Art Gallery of South Australia, moves away from this model and back towards a more traditional analysis largely based on colour. The exhibition includes more than 65 paintings from the famed Parisian museum curated by two of its staff – Marine Kisiel and Paul Perrin. There have been numerous Musée d’Orsay exhibitions in Australia, at least five, the most notable of these the impressive [The Impressionists: Masterpieces from the Musée d’Orsay](https://www.ngv.vic.gov.au/exhibition/the-impressionists/) at the National Gallery of Victoria in 2004. 


Although these exhibitions are an important part of the French gallery’s revenue stream and many are drawn from the back room collection, the selection of work for the Adelaide exhibition is a good one. A number of key pieces have been removed from the walls of Musée d’Orsay’s permanent display and at least 50 of the paintings have never previously been exhibited in Australia.

The exhibition is built around the [formalist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formalism_\(art\)) notion that the development of Impressionism can to some extent be interpreted as a development of colour theory. As the French painter [Maurice Denis](http://www.musee-orsay.fr/en/events/exhibitions/archives/exhibitions-archives/browse/4/article/maurice-denis-6780.html?print=1&) famously observed in 1890, “Remember that a painting – before being a battle horse, a nude woman, or an anecdote of some sort – is essentially a flat surface covered with colours, put together in a certain order”. 

Colours of Impressionism starts with the work of the French realist painter [Gustave Courbet](http://entrezdanslatelier.fr) who rejected the tinted marble-like surfaces of the French academic tradition and introduced generous amounts of black to his palette. He also played with white snow landscapes articulated with blue shadows. 


_[Colours of Impressionism: Masterpieces from the Musée d’Orsay](https://www.artgallery.sa.gov.au/agsa/home/Exhibitions/ComingSoon/Colours_of_Impressionism) is at the Art Gallery of South Australia until July 29 2018_
