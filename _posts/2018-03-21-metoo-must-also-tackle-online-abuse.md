title: '#MeToo must also tackle online abuse'
---
_Six months after the explosive[allegations of sexual harassment](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/05/us/harvey-weinstein-harassment-allegations.html) against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein came to light, giving impetus to the #MeToo movement, this [series](https://theconversation.com/au/topics/after-metoo-50716) looks at the aftermath of the movement, and if it has brought about lasting change to sexual harassment and gender equality._


Online abuse also has economic and social impacts, particularly when women choose to quit or avoid work where threats of harm and abuse are not uncommon (such as politics). 

For example, WiM reports that some members had left journalism as a result of their experiences online. A communications manager with more than 20 years’ experience said:

> It’s had a huge impact, including being the cause of changing my career as a journalist. 

## Social media platforms can do more

Unsurprisingly, social media is social – it’s people interacting with people. What happens in comments sections, on Facebook posts or Twitter threads is a reflection of the social power structures we all deal with on a daily basis. When social media platforms fail to act in a timely or consistent manner, or at all when users report abuse or harassment online, it reinforces those structures. 

Last year, Amnesty International UK [pointed to](https://www.amnesty.org.uk/files/Resources/Online-abuse-briefing.pdf) the need for better training for all staff – including developers, researchers, and especially moderators – at social media companies. 

In particular, platforms must be proactive rather than reactive in addressing these issues, and conduct public imposition of policies to ensure abusers are held accountable.


## The workplace can step up

In workplaces where social media use is expected or encouraged, the additional dangers women face in this environment need to be acknowledged and acted upon. Adequate training and support for staff members should be provided - including education about available legal options, and the creation of internal reporting mechanisms.

An example to consider is the ABC’s [Social Media Self Defence](http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/mediareport/social-media-self-defence/6958872) course. Started by Rod McGuinness in 2015, its aim is to equip ABC journalists, in particular women, with the skills and knowledge they need to make their experiences on social media less stressful. For McGuinness, this is part of a “duty of care” the ABC has to its employees.

We also need to consider how we support freelance or contract workers, like journalist Ginger Gorman, who has [written extensively](https://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/staring-down-internet-trolls-my-disturbing-cat-and-mouse-game-20170616-gwsmld.html) about her online experiences. Workers like these often don’t have access to workplace training and support, and also rely more heavily on their social media presence to generate paid work.

## Better responses from law enforcement

In 2016, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull pledged millions to [address online abuse and “revenge porn”](https://www.sbs.com.au/news/turnbull-calls-australia-s-domestic-violence-a-disgrace). The Senate’s [current inquiry](https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Senate/Legal_and_Constitutional_Affairs/Cyberbullying) into the adequacy of existing law enforcement measures to deal with cyberbullying is a step in the right direction. Hopefully it will lead to the establishment of clearer guidelines around reporting. The committee is due to report on March 28. 

Similarly, recent initiatives by state and territory police forces to better educate their officers around the issue are to be praised, as is the establishment of the Australian Cybercrime Online Reporting Network ([ACORN](https://www.acorn.gov.au/about-acorn)). 


That said, as submissions to the inquiry show, much still needs to be done to ensure that the police and the public are aware not just that cyberharassment or bullying is a crime, but how they might report it. These regulations need to be consistent across the country in recognition of the borderless nature of the online environment. 

The #MeToo and #TimesUp movements feel like a great moment of reckoning. As we work through these discussions, we also need to acknowledge that today’s workplace now extends beyond physical spaces. This means recognising the additional dangers women face in online spaces, such as social media, and acting to combat this.
