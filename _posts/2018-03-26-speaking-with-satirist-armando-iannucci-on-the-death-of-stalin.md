title: 'Speaking with: satirist Armando Iannucci on The Death of Stalin'
---
We’re living in something of a golden age for political satire. Politics and satire can even feel, at times, almost indistinguishable. 

But politics and comedy have never been that far apart. Charlie Chaplin’s 1941 film [The Great Dictator](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0032553/) ridiculed Adolf Hitler. More recently [The Thick of It](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qgrd) mocked the UK political class and [Veep](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1759761/) satirised US politics with very funny and scarily prescient results. 

Those latter two were written by Armando Iannucci, a Scottish writer and director who has been [described](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/6409167/Armando-Iannucci-interview.html) as the hardman of political satire. His new film, [The Death of Stalin](https://www.madmanfilms.com.au/the-death-of-stalin/), stars the likes of Steve Buscemi and Jason Isaacs and is about the chaotic political drama that followed the Russian leader’s demise in 1953.

For this episode of Speaking With, I spoke to Armando Iannucci, who warns that we should beware any politician who can’t take a joke. 

And, by the way, there’s a bit of swearing in this interview, so consider this a language warning. 

The Death of Stalin will be in cinemas March 29 across Australia.
