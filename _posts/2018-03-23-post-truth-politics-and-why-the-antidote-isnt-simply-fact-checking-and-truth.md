_This article is part of the Revolutions and Counter Revolutions series, curated by[Democracy Futures](https://theconversation.com/au/topics/democracy-futures)as a [joint global initiative](http://sydneydemocracynetwork.org/democracy-futures/) between the [Sydney Democracy Network](http://sydneydemocracynetwork.org/) and The Conversation. The project aims to stimulate fresh thinking about the many challenges facing democracies in the 21st century._

_It is also part of an[ongoing series](https://theconversation.com/au/topics/post-truth-initiative-38606) from the [Post-Truth Initiative](https://posttruthinitiative.org/), a Strategic Research Excellence Initiative at the University of Sydney._

_This essay is much longer than most Conversation articles, so will take some time to read. Enjoy!_


_The theme of truth, post-truth and the unfinished communications revolution is further explored in a recently published thepaper.cn interview,[The Revival of Truth Isnâ€™t the Remedy for Post-Truth](http://www.thepaper.cn/newsDetail_forward_1910750) (available only in Chinese)._
