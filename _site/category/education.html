        <p>
          Schools and students are often targeted during times of armed conflict. Abducted children can be recruited as soldiers and schools are ideal locations for military headquarters.

        <p>
          Despite serious financial and enrolment pressure for some, our universities are unlikely to close their doors – but some may have to resort to being 'merged' or taken over by a stronger partner.
