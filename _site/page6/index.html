        <p>
          Third places are shared spaces where people can informally socialise. As a potential antidote to the modern scourge of loneliness, it's worth asking what makes the best of these places tick.

          Brian Eno's Music for Airports, released 40 years ago, marked the formal beginnings of ambient music. It is still provoking composers and audiences to contemplate new ways of listening.

        <p>
          Most Aussies think we have such high rates of skin cancer due to an 'ozone hole'. But that's not the case. Here's why we have nearly a million cases of skin cancer per year.

          Sensors that monitor everything a self-driving vehicle does can help determine who is responsible in the case of an accident – the manufacturer, the service centre or the vehicle owner.
