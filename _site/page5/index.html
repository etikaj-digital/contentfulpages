        <p>
          It's surprising that news publishers seem to hand more power to Google because now more than ever there's an urgency to have clear barriers between news companies, social media platforms and search engines.

        <p>
          There's not much we can do about the reduction in collagen and fat that cause lines and circles under our eyes as we age. But sunscreen and a healthy lifestyle can help keep the signs of ageing at bay.

        <p>
          The most sustainable phone is the one you already own. But if you're in the market for a new handset, consider choosing one with replaceable parts to avoid having to replace the whole thing again.

        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>

        <p>
          Changes under Queensland's recently instituted Planning Act give councils much more leeway in their decision-making, which makes it harder for appeals against decisions to succeed.

        <p>
          Lowering the voting age to 16 would bring the age of political responsibility more in line with the age of criminal responsibility and the age of informed consent for medical procedures.

        <p>
          Artists have long tackled global issues, from war to human rights. While Picasso's celebrated Guernica may not have stopped the Spanish Civil War (or any war), art still holds value, as witness and as truth teller.
