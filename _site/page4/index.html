        <p>
          Our study found babies born via medical or surgical intervention were at increased risk of health problems, from jaundice and feeding issues, to diabetes, respiratory infections and eczema.

          An increasing list of rare diseases can now be treated with gene therapy. But we need to figure out a way to make them affordable.
