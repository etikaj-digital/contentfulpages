        <p>
          A new report shows building smaller houses as opposed to apartments in city fringes could provide more affordable housing.

        <p>
          Artificial islands that are now mushrooming across the ocean are regarded as 'engineering marvels'. But, little attention is paid to how these human-made structures affect sea life.

        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>

        <p>
          The clich√©s about housing supply and regulatory restraints are distractions from the need to focus on expanding the affordable housing sector to directly meet the needs of low-income households.

        <h1 class="catalogue-title">For Australians to have the choice of growing old at home, here is what needs to change</h1>
        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>

        <p>
          Millions of older Australians live in houses that don't safely meet their needs, but they're not ready for a nursing home. Lack of suitable housing and the moving costs leave them with nowhere to go.

        <h1 class="catalogue-title">Home ownership foundations are being shaken, and the impacts will be felt far and wide</h1>
        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>

        <p>
          Increasingly insecure pathways to home ownership are not just a problem for property markets. The fallout is likely to hit retirement incomes, the welfare base, gender equity and the broader economy.

        <h1 class="catalogue-title">How migration affects housing affordability</h1>
        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>

        <p>
          Australian governments are faced with a choice: make the difficult decisions to fix planning systems so more houses can be built, or tap the brakes on Australia's migrant intake.

        <h1 class="catalogue-title">Governments have no excuse for keeping public in the dark on public housing deals</h1>
        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>

        <p>
          The Victorian government isn't alone in seeking private partners to renew public housing. What is notable is its lack of transparency by comparison with such arrangements elsewhere.

        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>

        <p>
          There is a risk that affordable housing policy may be colonised by for-profit interests if Australia imports the wrong rental housing ideas from overseas.
