        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>

        <p>
          Many more people experience World Heritage online than in person. While that further elevates the status of iconic sites like the Sydney Opera House, it has other more complicated consequences too.

        <h1 class="catalogue-title">Cycling and walking are short-changed when it comes to transport funding in Australia</h1>
        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>

        <p>
          New analysis reveals just how little is spent on cycling and walking projects around Australia. No state's spending on cycling is more than 1.5% of its road funding.

        <h1 class="catalogue-title">Slow cycling isn't just for fun â€“ it's essential for many city workers</h1>
        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>

        <p>
          Cycling is a low-cost and non-polluting way to make deliveries in congested cities. Slow cyclists should be recognised as good for the economy and environment, not treated like second-class citizens.

        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>

        <p>
          Perth is looking at recycling all its sewage in the city's future water supply. But many Australians' drinking water already contains indirectly recycled treated sewage.

        <h1 class="catalogue-title">Key workers like nurses and teachers are being squeezed out of Sydney. This is what we can do about it</h1>
        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>

        <p>
          People on moderate incomes, including police and emergency workers, have been forced to seek housing on the city fringes, far from their places of work. But there are ways to reverse this trend.
