  <p>Five days unpaid family violence leave is a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/mar/27/coalition-says-it-will-legislate-unpaid-family-violence-leave-as-unions-voice-anger">significant improvement</a> over no guaranteed leave at all. But research shows that finances and domestic violence are inextricably linked.</p>

<p>Access to a steady income can mitigate the effects of violence and provide avenues out of abuse. Paid family violence leave is one tool to achieve this.</p>

<p>Research shows leaving an abusive relationship can <a href="http://www.dpac.tas.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0014/47012/pathways_how_women_leave_violent_men.pdf">be costly</a>. <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0003122414561117">This includes</a> the cost of relocation (such as breaking a lease or finding alternative housing), medical and counselling bills, increased transportation costs due to moving house or loss of access to a car, as well as lost earnings – among other financial burdens.</p>

<p>The Australian Council of Trade Unions places the total figure <a href="https://www.sbs.com.au/news/cost-of-fleeing-violent-relationship-is-18-000-and-141-hours-actu">at around A$18,000</a>.</p>

<p>Given this, financial hardship can bind women to abusive relationships. As such, the economic backing that ongoing employment supplies can be <a href="https://uknowledge.uky.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1000&amp;context=crvaw_reports">a critical factor</a> in supporting women to leave abusive relationships. Continued employment can also serve to psychologically bolster victims.</p>

<h2 id="the-impact-of-violence-on-earnings-and-employment">The impact of violence on earnings and employment</h2>

<p>Family violence can significantly impact lifetime earnings. This has flow-on effects for victims’ ability to live safe and healthy lives.</p>

<p>In Australia, approximately <a href="https://www.wgea.gov.au/sites/default/files/mcferran-domestic-violence-workplace-issue-australian-developments.pdf">two-thirds</a> of women experiencing domestic violence are in paid employment.</p>

<p>Research shows a significant correlation between the experience of domestic violence and reduced lifetime earnings. Some studies in the United States show a <a href="https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/pdfplus/10.1016/S0147-9121%2801%2920038-7">25% loss in income</a> associated with abuse.</p>

<p>Victims of domestic violence also experience <a href="https://www.wgea.gov.au/sites/default/files/mcferran-domestic-violence-workplace-issue-australian-developments.pdf">higher rates of part-time and casual work</a>, lower <a href="https://csd.wustl.edu/publications/documents/rp07-12.pdf">retirement savings</a> and <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1077801212474294">a lack of job stability</a>. Many lose their jobs as a direct result of violence.</p>

<p>The effects of violence are not only felt while the abuse is ongoing, but can reverberate for at least a<a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1077801212474294">further three years</a> after the violence has stopped.</p>

<p>This also has substantial consequences for career progression and therefore potential future earnings.</p>

<p>Victims of domestic violence are also more likely to experience <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1300/J134v08n03_02">food insecurity</a>, to <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1077801208315529">struggle to find affordable housing</a> and cover the <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1077801203255862">basic essentials like utility bills</a>.</p>

<p>Domestic violence victims are also more likely to <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1077801201007002003">experience anxiety</a> over their ability to support their children, even as compared to others on a low income. In fact, all of this is <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0003122414561117">intensified for low-income women</a>.</p>

<p>As <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1077801212474294">Adrienne Adams and her colleagues</a> explain, “whether it is a few hours out of a day, a few days out of a week, or a few months out of the year, missed employment opportunities translate into lost income”.</p>

<p>Providing paid family violence leave means we’re not asking victims to choose between forgoing necessary support for the sake of financial security.</p>

<p>It also means that victims may be better able to weather the storm of domestic and family violence and <a href="https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/theausinstitute/pages/1408/attachments/original/1482351910/Economic_Aspects_Domestic_Violence_Leave.pdf?1482351910">may be more productive at work</a> (although more research is required to assess this).</p>

<p>Providing family violence leave – and ensuring that it is paid – is a fundamental aspect of workplace support for victims.</p>

<p>Research also shows a symbiotic relationship between financial stress and rates of domestic violence. What people think about their own economic insecurity is <a href="https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/193434.pdf">closely associated</a> with higher rates of domestic violence, according to one comprehensive study in the United States.</p>

<p>By failing to provide family violence leave we risk re-entrenching existing forms of disadvantage and failing to address a potential contributing factor to the <a href="https://www.wgea.gov.au/addressing-pay-equity/what-gender-pay-gap">persistent gender pay gap</a> in this country.</p>

<p>Paid domestic and family violence leave only represents <a href="https://theconversation.com/domestic-violence-leave-gains-support-but-lets-do-it-right-51251">one aspect of a comprehensive response</a> that workplaces can provide, yet it is a substantial one.</p>

<p>The argument that paid domestic violence leave will negatively impact employers <a href="https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/theausinstitute/pages/1408/attachments/original/1482351910/Economic_Aspects_Domestic_Violence_Leave.pdf?1482351910">fails to take into account actual patterns of usage</a>, so the potential benefits seem to far outweigh the costs.</p>
