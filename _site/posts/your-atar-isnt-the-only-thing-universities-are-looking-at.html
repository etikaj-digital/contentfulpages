  <p>Only a quarter of undergraduate university admissions for domestic students are made on the basis of an ATAR (Australian Tertiary Admission Rank), according to a new discussion paper from Victoria University’s Mitchell Institute.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.mitchellinstitute.org.au/papers/crunching-the-number/">paper</a> highlights a growing disconnect between the role the ATAR plays in schools and universities. In 2016, only 26% of domestic undergraduate university admissions were made on the basis of secondary education with an ATAR – down from 31% in 2014.</p>

<p>This would surprise many young people, as it seems at odds with the message reinforced by many schools, families and the media – that the ATAR is everything.</p>

<p>The ATAR is a commonly used criterion for admission to undergraduate study. It is a nationally comparable percentile rank (given between 0 and 99.95 in increments of 0.5) signifying a student’s position relative to other students.</p>

<p>The ATAR, and the state-based ranking systems that preceded it, were designed to facilitate transparent and efficient selection to limited places in higher education. But the ranking has arguably taken on a life of its own. As Chief Scientist Alan Finkel <a href="http://www.chiefscientist.gov.au/wp-content/uploads/Universities-Australia-dinner-address.pdf">said</a> recently:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We…know the ATAR is a tool. <em>Students</em> treat the ATAR as the goal.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="multiple-pathways-to-entry">Multiple pathways to entry</h2>

<p>The introduction of the demand driven system in 2012 saw a removal of caps on Commonwealth supported undergraduate university places. Australia’s tertiary education sector has seen immense change since then, growing significantly and becoming more diverse and accessible.</p>

<p>Commencing <a href="https://www.education.gov.au/selected-higher-education-statistics-2016-student-data">higher education students rose</a> from around 410,000 in 2007 to nearly 600,000 by 2016. The 2017 Commonwealth decision to <a href="https://www.senatorbirmingham.com.au/sustainability-and-excellence-in-higher-education">freeze the funding</a> provided for Commonwealth supported undergraduate students may have some impact on this, although the extent is not yet known.</p>

<p>Regardless, we now have a flexible system, with multiple pathways to entry and more students applying directly to institutions.</p>

<p>Our new paper highlights that in 2017, around 60% of <a href="https://docs.education.gov.au/node/46066">domestic undergraduate university offers</a> were reported as non-ATAR or non-Year 12, showing a diversity of pathways to higher education.</p>

<p>Non-ATAR admissions can be made on the basis of secondary school results (without ATAR), previous higher education or VET study, professional qualifications, and mature age or equity entry pathways.</p>

<p>Universities are also turning to a number of <a href="https://docs.education.gov.au/system/files/doc/other/revised_20161115_pm_final_accessibility_version_hesp_admissions_transparency_report.pdf">alternative entry mechanisms</a> including aptitude tests, entrance exams and interviews. In 2017, <a href="https://docs.education.gov.au/system/files/doc/other/undergraduate_applications_offers_and_acceptances_2017.pdf">69% of undergraduate offers</a> in the fields of health and education were non-ATAR/non-Year 12. For nursing, this was 78%.</p>

<h2 id="schools-still-strongly-focused-on-atar">Schools still strongly focused on ATAR</h2>

<p>Much of senior secondary schooling is still strongly focused on the ATAR, an emphasis that can result in unintended consequences.</p>

<p>A significant number of final year students report <a href="https://www.missionaustralia.com.au/news-blog/news-media/youth-survey-report-2017">alarmingly high levels</a> of stress and anxiety as a result of study pressures.</p>

<p>Students may choose subjects they think will <a href="https://www.cese.nsw.gov.au/publications-filter/why-aren-t-students-studying-higher-level-maths.">maximise their ATAR</a> over pursuing talents and interests. It also distorts student choice about which pathway to pursue. Some students see high cut-off scores as an <a href="http://melbourne-cshe.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0009/2318085/Improv_Tertiary_Sel.pdf">indication of higher course quality</a>, and similarly, that to enrol in courses with cut-offs lower than their ATAR would be a “waste” of their scores.</p>

<h2 id="symptom-of-a-larger-problem">Symptom of a larger problem</h2>

<p>The reality is the ATAR is only one element of a larger and more complex picture. Many of the problems we associate with the ATAR are really symptoms of a broader disjuncture in the way we think about education and training pathways for young people.</p>

<p>To move forward, any reforms need to acknowledge that secondary and tertiary education form part of one ongoing learning pathway.</p>

<p>In education policy there is broad consensus on a number of high level goals – that education should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Develop the <a href="http://www.curriculum.edu.au/verve/_resources/National_Declaration_on_the_Educational_Goals_for_Young_Australians.pdf">foundation skills and broader capabilities</a> required to succeed in a changing world,</li>
  <li>support effective transitions from school to post-school life, and</li>
  <li>enable <a href="https://www.mq.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0013/135310/bradley_review_of_australian_higher_education.pdf">more school leavers to participate</a> in tertiary study or training.</li>
</ul>

<p>Yet our means of measuring success and facilitating access often seem at odds with these. This includes the ATAR.</p>

<p>The ATAR presents a challenging dilemma – it needs to measure and mark individual and school achievement, filter and sort applicants into appropriate pathways, and facilitate equity of access and equality of educational opportunity.</p>

<p>But given the changing role and purpose of both school and tertiary education, it’s timely to revisit how we facilitate young people’s pathways at this critical stage.</p>

<p>Collectively, governments, students and families are investing <a href="http://www.mitchellinstitute.org.au/reports/expenditure-on-education-and-training-in-australia-2017/">more than ever</a> in education and training in Australia.</p>

<p>There is a broad public benefit to ensuring this investment is spent wisely, and that we have the right framework in place to ensure as many students as possible make a good transition from schooling to the next steps in their lives.</p>

<p>It’s time to assess the ATAR and ask whether it helps or hinders us in achieving our shared education goals.</p>
