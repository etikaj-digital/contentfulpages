  <p>Australian universities can cut their budgets relatively quickly because of their <a href="http://www.lhmartininstitute.edu.au/documents/publications/2016-contingent-academic-employment-in-australian-universities-updatedapr16.pdf">very high rates of casualisation</a>. Neither does Australia have the North American tenure system, which protects tenured academics against redundancy, except in cases of the institution’s “<a href="https://www.aaup.org/report/financial-exigency-academic-governance-and-related-matters">financial exigency</a>” threatening the <a href="https://www.caut.ca/about-us/caut-policy/lists/caut-policy-statements/policy-statement-on-financial-exigency-and-lay-offs">survival of the institution as a whole</a>.</p>

<p>Cutting staff numbers and pay has recently been made even easier by the prospect of universities following <a href="https://www.fwc.gov.au/document/agreement/AE407853-2">Murdoch University</a> in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/may/18/labor-says-its-too-easy-for-bosses-to-drop-pay-deals">applying to terminate their enterprise agreement</a> which provides higher pay and better redundancy provisions than the basic award.</p>

<p>But building new programs, study modes, campuses and research strengths which attract students, financial support and esteem takes much longer. Universities under serious financial and enrolment pressure that cannot negotiate the time to build their way out of their difficulties are unlikely to be closed. The investment in campuses, institutional resources and staff are too valuable to discard.</p>

<p>And while some universities may not meet optimistic expectations of growth, they serve important roles in their communities which are valued all the more by smaller communities without other significant institutions. But they may have to resort to being “merged” or taken over by a stronger partner.</p>
