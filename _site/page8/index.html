          Student activists are presenting important, emotionally powerful counter-narratives to those of the gun lobby. Their success will depend on whether they can sustain these efforts.

        <p>
          The first IPCC conference on cities has highlighted the challenges of reconciling science, urban practices and politics. But it was an important recognition of cities' leading role in climate action.

        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>

        <p>
          Despite serious financial and enrolment pressure for some, our universities are unlikely to close their doors – but some may have to resort to being 'merged' or taken over by a stronger partner.

        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>

        <p>
