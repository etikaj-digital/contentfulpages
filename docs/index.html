          Brisbane alternative rock musicians Dead Letter Circus make affective and powerful music, epitomised by their album Aesthesis.

        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>

        <p>
          The best defence against post-truth politics is not &#39;the truth&#39;. Democracy should resist the political tyranny of claims to some immutable truth as a basis for governing the lives of others.

        <p>
          It&#39;s surprising that news publishers seem to hand more power to Google because now more than ever there&#39;s an urgency to have clear barriers between news companies, social media platforms and search engines.

        <h1 class="catalogue-title">Native forest protections are deeply flawed, yet may be in place for another 20 years</h1>
        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>

        <p>
          Agreements between the Commonwealth and state governments that protect native forests are based on hopelessly out-of-date information. It&#39;s a huge mistake to renew them without assessment.

        <p>
          The way corporations are structured makes it hard to establish criminal culpability even if directors and executives control processes and are paid bonuses based on performance.

          Despite skin conditions such as acne having no negative health effects, they can take a huge toll on the confidence and mental health of the person.
